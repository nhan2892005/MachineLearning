# Introduction

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI), has emerged as a testament to the 4.0 Industrial Revolution (1.0 - steam engine, 2.0 - electricity, 3.0 - information technology). 

AI is effect every aspect of our lives, often without us even realizing it. 
  - Self-driving cars from Google and Tesla
  - Apple's virtual assistant Siri
  - Amazon's product recommendation system
  - Youtube's videos recommendation system
  - Google DeepMind's AlphaGo
  - And many others are just a few examples of AI/Machine Learning applications.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI. According to Wikipedia, Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that “gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” 

Simply put, `Machine Learning` is a `branch of Computer Science` that enables computers to learn from input data without requiring explicit programming.

In recent years, as the computational power of computers has reached new heights and vast amounts of data have been collected by major tech companies, Machine Learning has taken a significant leap forward, giving rise to a new field called Deep Learning. 

Deep Learning has enabled computers to perform tasks that seemed impossible just a decade ago: classifying thousands of different objects in images, automatically generating captions for photos, mimicking human speech and handwriting, interacting with humans, and even creating literature or music.
